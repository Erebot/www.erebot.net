    <h1>Presentation</h1>
    <p>Erebot is an IRC bot written in PHP and released under GPL v3.0+</p>
    <p>
      First written as an exercise, the project became an original alternative
      to other bots (eg. rbot) as it grew larger.
      <br/>
      The code features advanced concepts of PHP (sockets, XML handling, custom
      streams, i18n, process manipulation, etc.).
    </p>
    <p>
      PHP 5(.3) is used as the base version, though the code may run under
      PHP 5.2.1+ with some work.
      <br/>
      Whenever possible, we try to avoid PHP 5.3.0-specific features
      (like namespaces, late static binding, etc.).
    </p>
    <p>
      We only use OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) to ensure ease of reading --
      no spaghetti code.
      <br/>
      And because we think QA is the key to making great softwares, the code ships
      with several unit tests.
    </p>
    <p>Erebot has a very modular codebase and currently supports the following features:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Plain-text and secure connections (through SSL/TLS, with some support for the STARTTLS extension)</li>
      <li>Channel auto-join upon connection</li>
      <li>Auto-reconnecting after the link gets down, combined with a lag checker</li>
      <li>
        Internationalization of most messages, with the possibility to set different
        languages for different channels/servers/networks
      </li>
      <li>A few popular games (Uno, Gang of Four, Roulette, Countdown)</li>
      <li>Some tools (a TV timetable, a calculator, etc.)</li>
      <li>And many other fearures you can discover by downloading the code!</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We welcome additional ideas for new features and modules.</p>
